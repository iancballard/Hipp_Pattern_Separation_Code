# Hipp Pattern Separation Code

This repository contains analysis code for the following paper:

Ian C. Ballard, Anthony D. Wager, Samuel M. McClure. Hippocampal Pattern Separation Supports Reinforcement Learning.

Raw behavioral and MRI data for this study can be accessed at: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001590

The code is contained within several IPython notebooks that performed the analyses and generated all figures used in the manuscript.

## Getting Started

The following software were used:
* FSL 5.0.8
* ANTS 1.9
* Lyman 0.0.10
* Freesurfer 5.3.3
* R 3.3.1

### fMRI Analysis with Lyman
First, the anatomical image for each subject was processed using Freesurfer's recon-all tool to generate the cortical surface models. 

Next, we prepare fieldmap images from two images taken with opposite phase encoding directions. Details can be found here: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/topup. The code for this analysis can be found in prepare_fieldmaps.ipynb.

Next, the functional data were preproccesed with FSL, Freesurfer, and Nipype using lyman. The processing used the experiment parameters in the sim.py and loc.py files included in this repository. This was performed with the following command line executions:

```
run_fmri.py -e sim -s subjects.txt -w preproc
run_fmri.py -e loc -s subjects.txt -w preproc
```

Next, we conducted an ICA decomposition (run_melodic.ipynb) and automatically classified and removed noise components (run_fix.ipynb). Details can be found at http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FIX/UserGuide.

Next, first-level models were fit to each run, registered to the space of the first functional run, and a fixed effects analysis was conducted.

```
run_fmri.py -e sim -altmodel PE -s subjects.txt -w model reg ffx -regspace epi
```

For the localizer experiment, data were registered to the first run of the SIM experment by using the following command:

```
run_fmri.py -e loc -s subjects.txt -w model reg ffx -regspace epi -regexp sim
```
